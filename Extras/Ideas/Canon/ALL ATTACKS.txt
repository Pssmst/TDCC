3a. Double Tap (Cost 3): Launches a ball towards an enemy, dealing a large amount of damage. It has a 50% chance to bounce back, letting you target another enemy or the same one, then a 25% chance to repeat, 12.5%, and so forth...

** After Reflection, Hyperdash becomes permanent and Adrenaline only further buffs damage.

2b. Remember: The effects depend on the fight.

3b. Keep Talking: Disables all other actions and progresses the story. It's like the "Save" option from the Asriel fight in Undertale.


GARRETT --------------------------------------- ATTACK

1a. Stealth Cloak: Grants a 50% chance to not take damage towards an enemy and increases Stealth by 16.7% (1/6). When using Stealth Cloak on the same enemy, Garrett will instead deal a medium amount of damage with the usual benefits of Stealth Cloak -- Although, the chance to not take damage drops to 25%. The Stealth Cloak will then reset.

2a. Nunchucks: Deals a regular amount of damage to an enemy.

3a. Blue Crown: Compares Garrett's attack to the targeted enemy's defense and turns it into a ratio. An absolute value will then be calculated between the ratio and every multiple of 0.25 from 0. The damage output will be the multiple (of 0.25) the ratio is closest to, multiplied by 100. This damage is FLAT.
- Only usable if at 100% Stealth -- all Stealth is drained in the process.
* Example: Garrett's attack is 48 and the enemy's defense is 94. 48:94 = 0.51, which is closest to the multiple 0.5, and that multiplied by 100 = 50. The Blue Crown will deal 50 damage.

1b. Advanced Cloak: Is the same as Stealth Cloak but shoots homing shurikens out with each attack. Phase 1 now damages due to the shurikens and phase 2 gains a damage buff.

2b. Katana Slash: Deals a considerably large amount of damage and inflicts *Bleeding*, which slowly drains an enemy's health over 5 turns.

3b. Getriss' Wrath: Only usable if at 100% Stealth -- Does an ungodly amount of damage towards one singular enemy. All Stealth is drained in the process.


PATRICK --------------------------------------- MAGIC ùöø / HEX ùõÄ

ùöø TRIGGER: Used to initiate a MODE ACTIVATION without any of those stupid special conditions that need to be fulfilled.
- Only avaliable if Patrick has reached 100% Sun and 100 DM; drains everything upon use.

1ùöø. Paint Gun: 50/50 chance to either inflict the Painted debuff or a random debuff from the pool below. Costs 50% Sun.

2ùöø. Peashooter: Depending on the amount of Sun Patrick has, a different type of peashooter will appear and attack at the end of each turn. Each one will only attack for 3 turns

- 50% Sun: Repeater - 10 damage (Targeted II)
- 75% Sun: Threepeater - 15 damage (Targeted III)

ùõÄ SIPHON: Increments Patrick's DM by 20 but must steal either a 'point' of Energy, Mana, Adrenaline, or Stealth. It's in the same place as Destin's CHARGE
* Example: Patrick siphons from BRANNON! -33% Adrenaline / +20 DM

1ùõÄ. Oblivio (40% DM): Covers the enemy in complete darkness, lowering their attack by 75% for a single turn.
