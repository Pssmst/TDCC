Brannon remembers how Destin would jokingly say that he was “always right,” and how much it angered him because of how often it was true. Destin would win nearly every argument he and Brannon had, even if Brannon was right, and it never failed to make Brannon feel worse about himself in the end.

Brannon remembers the day Destin told him he was dating someone. Everyone was so proud of him. Everyone except for Brannon, and he felt bad for thinking so. He remembers watching her look for Destin in the percussion section during every band practice, and the feeling of jealousy he felt from it. Why didn’t he have a girlfriend? Was he not good enough of a person?!

Brannon remembers his obsession over Homestuck and how Destin would ask him to shut up about it any time he brought it up. He remembers how angry he felt when, in contrast, Destin would take interest in something and people would love to talk about it with him and support him.

What could have caused such anger to spark in Destin? Why did he react so violently to Brannon’s confession? Another thought comes to him. It’s a thought he buried the day he left the friend group.
