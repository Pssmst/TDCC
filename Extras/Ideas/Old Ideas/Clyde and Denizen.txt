"Is God real?"
"He's not what you think."
"Have you met him?"
"No," Denizen says monotonously, "And I don't want to."

Clyde stares off into the distance. A thought occurs to him, "What if you punched me?"
Denizen stops pacing, "If I punched you?" He makes a face, "What the hell do you think would happen if I punched you?"
"Hey, no bad words, mister," Clyde says, having said the F-word exactly 43,372 times in his lifetime.
"If I punched you," Denizen continues, ignoring Clyde, "You would die."
"Aight, bet."
Clyde and Denizen exchange a glance for a solid 5 seconds.
"I hate you."
"Cool," Clyde responds, "So, how powerful IS your punch? You're the, uh... 'The Keeper of the Universe,' so--"
"The Multiverse," Denizen interrupts sourly.
"--The Keeper of the Multiverse, so could you, like, beat Saitama?"
Denizen's face drops into an even more miserable expression, "Yes."

Suddenly, Denizen and Clyde are back on Earth.
"Good riddance," Denizen mumbles.
The fabric of reality whizzes by Clyde once again.
Denizen turns around, meeting eye-to-eye with Clyde. He stops dead in his tracks, "Why are you still here?"
"Huh?" Clyde asks, not quite understanding what's going on.
"The only person who can travel the Multiverse like that is me. That, and..." Denizen grimaces, "...You've gotta be kidding me." He snaps his fingers and puts his hand over Clyde's eyes, "Close your eyes. If you look at this, you'll die an agonizing death."
"What if I want to die an agonizing death?" Clyde asks stupidly, his vision blocked.
"Be my guest," Denizen mumbles, clearly not paying attention to him.
"What even is it?"
"It's a map of the Multiverse."
"Why do you have a map of the Multiverse?"
"Because I'm looking for something."
"What are you looking for?"
"None of your business," Denizen sighs, "...I hope."

Clyde looks around him, "How am I breathing out here?"
"Plot armor."
"What do you mean?"
"You're a character in a book."
"That's cool."
