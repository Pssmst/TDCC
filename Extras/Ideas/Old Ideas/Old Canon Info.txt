Long ago existed a force so powerful that it rendered gods asunder. This sacred form of dark magic is known as "cringe." There are six elements of cringe, but not all of them are equal. Instead, the elements are categorized into a pyramid of sorts. 

At the bottom-most layer of the cringe pyramid are the basic three: Solitude, ego, and misfortune. Solitude is built on loneliness, ego is built on pride, and misfortune is built from tragedy. 

On the second layer are the main two: Rage and Regret. Rage represents unbridled animosity and is built on two concepts: Dislike and misunderstanding. Regret represents deep remorse and is built on two other concepts: Embarrassment and sorrow. 

On the final layer of the pyramid is the most devastating of them all: LUST. Lust is the combination of both regret and rage, and it represents a deep, burning desire for more. It is built on three concepts: Libido, power, and vulgarity. 

Ultimately, if a creature possesses these traits simultaneously, they will descend to their darkest form: Perfect Cringe. Not much is known about this form, as it has never been achieved. There is a theory though, that if one were to reach the most magical location -- the summit of the mountain -- with someone of each element with them, the concentrated mana of each element may begin to form a being of somewhat Perfect Cringe qualities. 

Long ago, the great wizards banished this power deep into the tallest mountain they knew. As time progressed, Mount Celeste began to possess magical properties, and soon, it had began to defend itself to protect it's core, the Perfect Cringe. The deepest regrets of man, locked up within the furthest part of the mountain. Now, the mountain uses its power to psychologically torture its climbers in an attempt to ward them off. Although, none of those who do climb the mountain even know of its secret, and are merely there to challenge themselves on their climb to the summit. 





"Do you not remember anything they said!?"
"Do you not recall all the horrible things you did!?"

"I remember everything, and it changes nothing."


Because of Clyde:

- No one watched Demon Slayer.
- Landon & Garrett would've never watched One Punch Man.
- Garrett's funny vocabulary doesn't happen.
- Clyde never reads Homestuck w/ Brannon.
- Only Brannon plays Omori.
- Destin stays mad.
- Noel and his siblings don't exist.
- Patrick and Clyde's wacky prank / Brannon cusses absolutely never

Cringe Attacks:

- Ultravoilet
- Hyperblack
- Pink Death
- LUST

In the actual game, the dogs fight acts a lot like the ASGORE fight with talking and remembering, with tons and tons of dialogue and stuff, but the fight can only actually 'end' if you use STAB on DIAXR.
