# The Dogs Climb Celeste (TDCC)

My name is Brannon Davidson. I wrote a book about an alternate universe version of my friends and I climbing a mountain. This mountain happens to be the same mountain that a group Canadian developers made a game about, and that game inspired this book.



# BLURB


Four friends and a mountain they climb together.
Don’t say I didn’t warn you…


“The art isn’t the art. The art is never the art. The art is the thing that happens inside you when you make it, and the feeling in the heart of the beholder.”
