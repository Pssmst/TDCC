# The Dogs Climb Celeste (TDCC)

TDCC is a lot of things. In the very beginning, it was nothing but an inside joke. I had begged Destin to play Celeste, and he painstakingly did so. He seemed to hate every second of it (heâ€™s very bad at platformers), yet still enjoyed it at times. Watching him play got me thinking: I wonder how everyone else would feel about playing the game?

(At this time, the friend group consisted of me, Destin, Landon, Garrett, and Patrick. It was only a year later that Clyde found his way in, but more on that later.)

One thing lead to another, and in just a few days I had began imagining a world where Celeste mountain was real, and all of my friends had to climb it. I thought it was very humorous, and when presenting the idea to my friends, they thought it was funny as well. Some of them even told me what they thought would happen, and slowly we starting adding to the story in the form of impulsive, dumb jokes. Most of them were from me.

That was when I started writing. I pulled up a text document on my Chromebook, a Christmas gift from a few years prior, and started writing the first chapter. At that point I had gotten the basic structure of the plot down: Five years after I leave the friend group in 2023 (2 years in the future from when I started writing) I come back and make my friends climb the mountain. We meet the antagonist, Cringe (basically just me at my worst), and defeat him upon reaching the summit. It was a perfect plan.

A couple days into writing the first chapter, I stopped, and I forgot about it. That was when it should have been over. The joke was dead, and my second idea for a book (following MultiJumper, which was a failure) was so broad that it was nearly impossible to complete.
