# The Dogs Climb Celeste (TDCC)

My name is Brannon Davidson. I wrote a book about an alternate universe version of my friends and I climbing a mountain. This mountain happens to be the same mountain that a group Canadian developers made a game about, and that game inspired this book.



# BLURB


Four friends and a mountain they climb together.
Don’t say I didn’t warn you…


“The art isn’t the art. The art is never the art. The art is the thing that happens inside you when you make it, and the feeling in the heart of the beholder.”
— No Boilerplate, on The Cult of Done Manifesto


Warning! This book has:

— Mature content not suited for children, such as offensive language, crude humor, underage consumption of alcohol, themes of grief, suggestive topics, suicidal topics, and ego death.

— Offensive (and downright false) examples of the LGBTQ+ and furry community. All content is purely for dramatic effect and is extremely exaggerated, if not completely fabricated.

— Dangerously high concentrations of cringe. If you can’t handle it, then I recom- mend setting the book down and taking a break.

— A wacky plot in which 80% of it was conceived in the shower and hastily scribbled on a sticky note.

— A thousand different examples of plagiarism. This is an inside joke that I’ve been working on for three years and I DO NOT intend on making a profit off of it!
